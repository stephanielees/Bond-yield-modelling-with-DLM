# Bond-yield-modelling-with-DLM
Modelling the 10-year Treasury using the third order polynomial and moving average (MA) in DLM.

Data source: https://home.treasury.gov. I collected the yield data for several years (Jan 2018 - Aug 2023) for this project.

The demo video will be uploaded soon in my Youtube channel.
