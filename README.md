# Bond-yield-modelling-with-DLM
Modelling and forecasting the 10-year Treasury using the third order polynomial and moving average (MA) in DLM.

Data source: https://home.treasury.gov. I collected the yield data for several years (Jan 2018 - Aug 2023) for this project.

Two R files are included here. Even though they are really similar, the modelling file focuses more on the fitting process, whereas the forecasting file explores the forecasting in more detail.

The video demonstrating the codes for modelling is [here](https://youtu.be/yraYUalF1Rw), and the forecasting video is [here](https://youtu.be/RYnaSK7ueYM). <br>
